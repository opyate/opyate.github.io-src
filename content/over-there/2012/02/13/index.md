# In Memoriam

_Section CXXIII_

There rolls the deep where grew the tree.
      O earth, what changes hast thou seen!
      There where the long street roars, hath been 
The stillness of the central sea.

The hills are shadows, and they flow
      From form to form, and nothing stands;
      They melt like mist, the solid lands, 
Like clouds they shape themselves and go.

But in my spirit will I dwell,
      And dream my dream, and hold it true;
      For tho' my lips may breathe adieu, 
I cannot think the thing farewell.
